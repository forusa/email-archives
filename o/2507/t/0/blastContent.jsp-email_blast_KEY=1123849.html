<p class="byline">By Julia Nelson</p>
<p>Of all the unique satisfactions of being an international accompanier,       one of the greatest pleasures is visiting the Peace Community members in       their homes. These visits provide not only a source of enjoyment and connectedness,       but also an opportunity for deeper understanding into the reality of day       to day survival within this admirable struggle for peaceful living. Whether       seeking a snack of <i>arepas</i> or a friendly conversation, walking into       a home here may also open the door to witnessing firsthand the tangible       effects of the armed conflict that continues to surround and invade the       lives of these peasant farmers (<i>campesinos</i>).</p>
<p>On the evening of November 8<sup>th</sup> as I went to visit my friend       and neighbor in the Peace Community, I found myself staring into the faces       of the latest victims of the war in this region. Having walked all day       from their homes in the settlement of La Esperanza to come to where we       live in La Uni&oacute;n, this family of four had just been displaced from       their land earlier that day, bringing with them only what they could carry       on their backs. As they wearily ate their dinner, they shared with me their       story of how the events of the past few days had unfolded, having been       forced from their homes to flee for their lives. And this was only the       beginning.</p>
<p>When reflecting on the significance of the Peace Community, I think about       these campesinos without whom this community would not have been created       or could not persist in the face of countless losses and endless threats;       I think about their values of non-violence, neutrality and dignity upon       which the community has established itself as apart from the rest. And       I cannot help but acknowledge and admire the undeniable importance of these       fertile lands in the mountains of Urab&aacute; on which these farmers have       survived and continue to cultivate their lives, despite the armed actors,       including the Colombian military, the guerilla and the paramilitaries,       who all desire and even combat to take over this space of the Peace Community.</p>
<p>Amidst this territorial struggle, the community was born. The Peace Community       began when hundreds of campesinos were forced from their lands almost twelve       years ago by the armed conflict overrunning their homes and the paramilitaries       terrorizing their lives. Although distressed and displaced, a group of       these farmers would not accept this unwarranted takeover of their fields.       Founding and organizing the Peace Community, many farmers therefore started       to return to their homes in the conflict-ridden mountain sides. Not only       were these returns a display of their courage and strength, but was also       a statement of their collective will to live peacefully and neutrally in       their land, which they had cultivated for decades.</p>
<p>Yet to this day, these Peace Community members and the land they have       reclaimed are still being threatened by the paramilitaries. Over the last       few years and even as recently as this past February, FOR has accompanied       the members as they have officially returned to three settlements of the       community. However, just this past month the Peace Community once again       experienced the devastating effects of the conflict in and around their       homes, as a number of farmers in La Esperanza have been displaced from       their homes. However, the Peace Community refuses to neither surrender       their land nor let these violations go unaddressed; the community has already       publically denounced these recent injustices and declared its unwavering       position of non-violent resistance to this illegal armed group.</p>
<p>On November 7<sup>th</sup>, a large group of armed and identified paramilitaries       entered into the settlement of La Esperanza, which is also home to members       of the Peace Community. Because it is well-known in the region that the       neighboring settlement to La Esperanza is controlled by these paramilitaries,       the community acknowledged this invasion as an attempt to spread their       authority into this territory. With guns and verbal abuse, this illegal       armed group threatened some of these campesinos, saying that they were       going to be killed unless they displaced from their homes. Five families       immediately displaced from this settlement, which in turn increased the       level of risk of displacement for those that remained, including the families       of the Peace Community. When gunshots were heard on the following day,       even more families from La Esperanza displaced from their homes for fear       of finding themselves yet again amidst the presence of paramilitaries,       and thus of continued threats on their lives.</p>
<p><span lang="es-CO">On November 17th, Peace Community leaders accompanied         by FOR went to La Esperanza, having heard that the only people that had         stayed were the members of the community while all the other farmers         had been displaced. </span><span lang="es-CO">In order to maintain a         strong presence in this settlement and increase security for these campesinos,         the community leaders gathered and met with the remaining families. By         encouraging these community members to stay on their lands and to work         together, these campesinos would demonstrate their continued opposition         to the armed conflict through their collective refusal to abandon their         lands. Despite the paramilitary movements around the community settlement,         these farmers believe that maintaining the presence of the Peace Community         in La Esperanza is a form of peaceful resistance to the control of the         armed groups. </span>Recognizing themselves as the only remaining obstacle         to the armed groups taking complete control of this area, these Peace         Community members agreed to stay in their homes.</p>
<p>These campesinos bravely and boldly decided not to relinquish their land       for which they have already sacrificed so much to keep, including previous       displacements, a number of assassinations and countless threats throughout       the almost twelve years of the Peace Community's existence. <span lang="es-CO"> With       the political support and physical presence of FOR and other international       organizations, these families of the community have overcome any fears       in order to proceed with their work and lives in their own homes. Nonetheless,       the reality of the threat of forced displacement and of the invasion of       paramilitaries continues to exist in this region; however, as we have witnessed       firsthand this past month, the strength and determinance of the Peace Community       have also proven to unwieldingly persevere.</span></p>

<h2 class="heading"><a id="xxx" name="xxx"></a><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt;"><b>Indigenous     Protests Arrive in Bogota</b></font></h2>
<p><a href="http://alternativasypensamiento.blogspot.com/2008/11/miles-de-indgenas-colombianos-llegan.html"><img width="320" hspace="4" height="188" align="left" alt="[protest photo]" src="../../../../../3.bp.blogspot.com/_iharoUHGx80/SSW7lQsedRI/AAAAAAAAAsg/-k4kiBlMyYI/s320/La%20Minga%20colombia.jpg" /></a>  Since the 12<sup>th</sup> of October, indigenous communities and organizations   have been protesting in Colombia. Their protests began in the southern departments   of Colombia, brought them to Cali and ended in Bogota. They managed to get   Uribe to the negotiating table on November 2<sup>nd</sup> for a meeting with   2,000 participants while another 4,000 watched a television broadcast from   a nearby farm. According to an <a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=44564">article</a> published   in IPS News, Uribe was bothered that some of the indigenous people at the meeting   did not stand up when the national anthem was played. According to Quilcu&eacute;,   a top leader of the Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC), one of the   country's most powerful indigenous associations, "We can't say we're operating   in a framework of respect when we have been called terrorists and criminals." She   was refering to the fact that on October 11, Uribe acccused the demonstrators   of being guerrillas and terrorists. Referring to Uribe's "democratic security" policy   and the heavy U.S. financing of government forces in Colombia's civil war,   Quilcu&eacute;   complained that "democratic security has been used to kill civilians," and "Plan   Colombia has been at the service of democratic security."   Despite six hours of talks, Uribe did not give into the main demands made by   the indigenous community. In turn, they decided to continue protesting and   brought their march of 40,000 people to Bogota's city center.</p>
<p>On Friday, November 21<sup>st</sup>, after 42 days of protest, the <i>minga</i> (a   traditional indigenous term which refers to the collective good) announced   a <a href="http://colombia.indymedia.org/news/2008/11/95850.php">pact</a> with   other social sectors. "With the power of Mother Earth, sustenance from   the rain, energy from a sporadic son, spiritual guidance from 102 indigenous   communities, the accompaniment of the national and international community   and the presence of more than 40,000 walkers, our words fell upon our collective   plaza [of Bogota]." They committed to continue their struggles and to reconverge   on October 12<sup>th</sup> of 2009.</p>
<p>Over the course of the protests, three indigenous protesters were killed and   around 170 people injured, including 39 police officers.</p>

<h2 class="heading"><a id="xxx" name="xxx"></a><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt;"><b>Human     Rights Carnaval and March in Medellin</b></font></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forpeace/3078939132/"><img width="360" hspace="4" height="240" align="right" alt="Carnaval Medellin, by Mayra Moreno" src="../../../../../farm4.static.flickr.com/3244/3078939132_b796fbdc29_o.jpg" /></a>The month of October was dedicated to carrying out various activities as part   of the <a href="http://www.forosocialmedellin.org">Social Forum in Medellin</a>. There were many workshops, activities, and   presentations that focused on social issues particular to youth, public services,   security and crime, social conditions for local residents, displaced people,   and many other topics that merited the attention of social organizations and   civil society. The Youth Network of Medellin (RED-Juvenil de Medellin) participated   and put together some of the activities of the Forum. They specifically asked   FOR to observe one of the most visible activities that took place in the city   center: The March &amp; Carnival for Human Rights.</p>
<p>On the 30th of October, everyone was gathered at around 9:00am ready to start   the carnival. The crowd was colorful, excited, vibrant and loud voices of familiar   faces, friends, relatives, and activists echoed with the city noise in the   background. There were people of all ages with entire families gathered to   march for all the rights they believe should be demanded publicly and loudly.   I was highly impressed by all the energy and smiles that were shared and expressed   by all the participants. I was also surprised to see the talented six-year-olds   in costumes wearing the 6ft long leg sticks that gave the march the kind of   colors and visuals you usually get in a circus. "Get the camera!" "Did   you see his costume?" "What are the police saying?" "When are we   going to start marching?" were some of the comments I heard while I searched   for the Youth Network's Security team to get information before the Carnival   would being marching.</p>
<p><strong>Waiting to Start</strong></p>
<p>I noticed that there was a strong presence of policemen/women at the front   of the crowd talking to the various organizers. They were debating the plan   of action. The organizers wanted to proceed with the route they originally   planned: pass through the Police's Command Station and have a public presentation   in front of it. The police wanted otherwise. The state security refused to   accept the continuation of the march if it meant that the citizens would pass   by their command station and wanted the organizers to offer an alternative   route. The Police also added "if the march proceeds as planned and passes   through the command station, we will have to call the riot police (ESMAD)".   This was a moment of tension. The organizers knew that if the ESMAD showed   up, it would generate violence and that it would be a catalyst for chaos. A   member of the Youth Network explained that   "There have been many incidents in which the riot police uses strong violence   against the participants and activists, inclusively last week students at the   university were brutalized by them."</p>
<p>After more long minutes of dialogue between the organizers and the police   a consensus was reached: the Carnival would change its route and avoid passing   through the police station. "We don't want to be susceptible to acts of   violence and we want to make sure that these kind of public actions don't lose   their focus so we will rather have a peaceful march and be flexible," said   one of the Youth Network's members.</p>
<p><strong>And they marched&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Around 10:00am the carnival began! The indigenous community that was participating   gathered and initiated the march with an honoring ceremony and asked that everyone   respect mother Earth and each other. Then the music began to play and there   was no way this crowd could be ignored by passersby. There were people with   a megaphone speaking out against the social injustices they have to endure,   the threats made against human rights defenders, social organizers, and union   workers. The threats, they said, "also come directly from the State and   the authorities." The children were dancing at the front of the march with   their costumes while a live marching band followed. I was observing from the   front of the crowd and noticed on the periphery there was more presence of   police units. According to the Organized Community Network (ROC in Spanish)   members, it is usually in the front of the march where more observation is   needed in order to keep the crowd organized and to respond to emergencies.   Being in the front also allowed the organizers to talk to the authorities in   case anybody tried preventing the carnival from continuing its course.</p>
<p>The Human Rights March was indeed a carnival. The crowd had three different   kinds of live music playing, including the Youth Network's Chirimia Band. There   were an estimated 700-800 participants and many people dressed in costumes,   with make-up and/or chanting a slogan. Some of the more visible costumes were   a Caracol (Colombian mainstream media channel) news reporter with exaggerated   breasts and a sign that read "Nothing wrong happens here", a statue of   liberty with the face of a skeleton and stickers with Exxon, McDonalds, and   Coca Cola, and a soldier with a gun that would pass around intimidating people.</p>
<p>Themes that were highlighted during the march were: disadvantages of the privatization   of public services, the mainstream media's lack of interest in addressing social   issues, womyn's rights, displaced people's conditions, university students'   right to express themselves, indigenous peoples' rights to their land, and   the right to have cultural celebrations in public spaces.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure that in Medellin, people are not stopped from expressing   themselves because they fear for their lives. We want to make these public   actions a kind of doorway so that people can celebrate their right to express   themselves freely and collectively. That is why we are calling it a carnival,   because we want to be loud, be excited, and still address those issues that   we have to face everyday when our human rights are not respected. We don't   want to be afraid to express ourselves," says a member of the Youth Arts Network   who has been part of the organization for over six years.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Sancocho for Everyone</strong></p>
<p>During the entire four hours of the march the crowd did not cease to be loud   and active. The participants who were performing dances and playing live music   continued to do so until the end of the march, which was around 2:00pm. Luckily   no major incidents happened although many people said they had identified policemen   dressed as civilians. This is worrisome for most participants, as they expressed   that undercover policemen take pictures of them and use that information to   intimidate and frame them for crimes. Some participants also mentioned cases   in which the undercover policemen would provoke a fight or dispute as a strategy   to end a march and/or activity and arrest people.</p>
<p>After hours under the extremely hot sun everyone was hungry and thirsty and   with partially melted make-up on their faces. The carnival ended in front of   a union worker's organization where four huge (about 3 &frac12; ft tall) pots   of boiling Sancocho (a kind of stew with traditional Colombian vegetables and   meat) were waiting for everyone.</p>
<p>It was definitely a wonderful experience to see non-violent initiatives take   place in a context where activists and those who challenge the status quo continue   to be victims of threats and violence. The best part was witnessing how fear   is transformed into a carnival and for organizations such as the Youth Network   of Medellin to be able to dance and sing as they ask for their human rights   to be respected.</p>

<h2 class="heading"><b>Balance   of the Tour: Everything Changed, Everything Same</b></h2>
<p><a title="Isaac at Merch Table by Fellowship of Reconciliation, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forpeace/3031721485/"><img width="240" hspace="4" height="180" align="left" alt="Isaac at Merch Table" src="../../../../../farm4.static.flickr.com/3288/3031721485_e22536e968_m.jpg" /></a>  After 21 days on the road, 2557 miles driven and countless cafeteria meals - things   are both different and the same. For example, before the tour our van was just   another rental car with nothing unique about it. We returned it well used,   more fragrant (!) and with a new name: the planet of Tranquilandia. Maybe more   importantly, when the tour started the entire country was waiting with baited   breath for the results of the election. Now we know that Obama will be our   next US president. According to most people I've talked to, this means that   some positive changes are likely to come about, but that we are not going to   see an overhaul of the entire world order. Before the tour, political hip hop   from Detroit had nothing to do with youth resistance in Colombia. Now Invincible's   rhymes and Paula's stories of creative resistance are flowing together&hellip; in   people's imaginations, thoughts and maybe even dreams. And yet, there is still   war in Colombia, displacement in Detroit and a poverty draft of young people   of color and the poor.</p>
<p>If we were executives in a big corporation we might ask: what are the measurable   outcomes of our work? Was there return on investment? Our questions are framed   differently in this laboratory of resistance (as we like to call it), but they   are still questions we have to ask ourselves: what is the balance of this tour?   We stretch our necks to look around us: have we changed the world yet? Are   things different now? Is there less war, violence, poverty and racism? Is there   more revolutionary love?</p>
<p><a title="DBND tour 08 northeastern 027 by Fellowship of Reconciliation, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forpeace/3078127189/"><img width="240" hspace="4" height="180" align="right" alt="DBND tour 08 northeastern 027" src="../../../../../farm4.static.flickr.com/3023/3078127189_5e54abbbf0_m.jpg" /></a> I can safely say yes, we brought people together. We made connections between   local, national and international struggles. We worked with and supported student   organizers. We opened up spaces for important issues to get talked about. Folks   felt inspired. And as organizers we learned some good lessons.</p>
<p>I invited a friend and supporter of the FOR Colombia program to our final   workshop and event in New York City. He showed up with his three younger siblings   and afterwards wrote me an email saying, "We just got home from the event   in Manhattan and I wanted to thank you again for the invitation. My siblings   thought it was a great, interactive event. Afterwards, they told me that that   was the first time they heard of conscientious objection and the first time   they ever had a space to talk about the military in a critical way. I think   it helped for them to hear about something that could be considered "radical"   from someone other then myself. The conversations that continued after the   event were ground breaking and I think it brought us closer together."</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, his email spoke to a success, albeit on a microcosmic   level, of this tour. After all, this movement is made up of people: people   and their families, friends and enemies, co-workers, bosses and neighbors.   As people we are trying to love and challenge each other. Through one of our   workshops, my friend had the opportunity to both break new ground with his   family in taking a critical look at militarism, while at the same time feel   closer to them. What else are we doing if not bringing our passion to create   a more just world to the very center of our personal relationships?</p>
<p>Last spring I heard Andrea Smith speak, a native activist/academic and founder   of Incite! Women of Color Against Violence. She suggested that the left has   something to learn from the way that activists on the Christian right invest   their time and resources in making relationships with people. She used the   example of phone banking: instead of asking for a donation or contact information,   they simply call you up to say a prayer for your health and well being. This   action creates a connection and is a long-term investment in that individual;   it is the Christian right's version of "movement building." She challenged   the folks in the audience to think about how we can invest in the movement   for the long term and not always be focused on our immediate goals of raising   X amount of money or securing X number of signatures.</p>
<p>I cannot claim that our Drop Beats Not Bombs tour perfectly carried out a "movement   building" model. Like I said above, we faced our share of challenges along   the way, we learned from them and have hopefully become better organizers because   of them. But if anything is a measurable outcome, it is the relationships we   built along the way -   the relationships the five of us on tour developed with each other during the   countless hours in the van, the relationships that we started (and will continue   to cultivate) with student organizers, the connection we made with an Israeli   conscientious objector in Ithaca and the relationships strengthened among others   because the tour offered a space for discussion, connection and analysis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forpeace/3078952894/"><img width="240" hspace="4" height="180" align="left" alt="Paula, Liza, and Maryrose in New York" src="../../../../../farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/3078952894_806fc0d599_m.jpg" /></a>Our last day together we spent touring New York City. Paula wanted to see   the Statue of Liberty so we took the boat there and clutched our coats to our   ears to keep out the cold as we peered up at that huge, green lady of liberty.   I felt a mix of feelings: hope, disappointment, exhaustion, idealism and cynicism.   Somehow it seemed strangely apropos to be there -- in the balance of it all,   with a new president-elect, with lessons learned from our time on the road,   the State of Liberty was there in all her splendor. I thought to myself that   she <i>does</i> stand for something, for a big vision of what could be, one   of those archetypal symbols that loom on our psychological horizon. And at   the same time, I wished our country would live up to what she stands for.</p>
