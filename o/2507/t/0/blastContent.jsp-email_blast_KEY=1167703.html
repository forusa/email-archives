<p><b>Betty Hall McFarlane</b> died on December 11th, 2009 of Alzheimer's disease at her home at Terwilliger Plaza, in Portland. She was born Elizabeth Ann Hall on August 3, 1932 in Vancouver, WA to Frances Jones Hall and Andy Hall. She often told stories of growing up during the depression and listening to the radio program "Let's Pretend" (she always remembered the words to the Cream of Wheat radio commercial).</p>
<p>After elementary school she attended Shumway Jr. High ("Hats off to thee"). In 1950, Betty graduated with honors from Vancouver High School, She completed her freshman year at Western Washington University, attended Clark college, then transferred to Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland. Betty majored in education and was active in singing and religious organizations. A lifelong interest in social justice resulted from working with migrant worker children. She worked as a waitress at The Holland and Waddell's restaurants to put herself through school. She graduated with honors in 1955.</p>
<p>While at Lewis &amp; Clark, she met Robert (Bob) McFarlane, and they were married on August 20, 1955. Betty taught elementary school for the Parkrose and Riverdale School districts while Bob went to medical school. Four children quickly followed. The growing family moved often while Bob finished medical training and the young family lived in Portland, a Detroit inner city housing project and New York State. The family went to Iran to be medical missionaries for three years in 1967: Betty was active in the church and her children's schooling while Bob was a surgeon at Tabriz Christian Hospital. This experience was transformative for the entire family and cemented Betty's lifelong commitment to humankind.</p>
<p>Betty and her family returned to Portland where she developed strong interests in women's studies, feminism, and causes of peace and justice. The changes for Betty and her family were profound: the children learned to cook, do their own laundry, and make protest signs at an early age. Betty learned to play guitar in her mid-forties after meeting the singer-songwriter Malvina Reynolds. She became involved in the Portland Folklore Society and began writing songs. From this point on Betty's music and the friendships she made through music were central for the rest of her life. Betty loved attending Puget Sound Guitar Workshop, where she became an inspiring and beloved musician, mother and sister to all. Throughout her life Betty continued to promote the causes of justice, peace and freedom was involved in many acronyms: FOR (Fellowship of Reconciliation), WILPF (Women's International League For Peace &amp; Freedom); AFSC (American Friends Service Committee); PSR (Physicians For Social Responsibility); and AA (Al-Anon). In the 1980's Betty went to Nicaragua twice with Elders for Survival to support land reform, fair trade and economic justice.</p>
<p>Betty loved people, adored her family, and reveled in being a grandmother. She showed her love in many ways. She helped care for both her parents as they aged and began to suffer from dementia. She loved walks in Forest Park, spending time with siblings and in-laws, and a favorite activity was going on "Red Hat Mama" trips with her mother and other women in the family. </p>
<p>Betty is survived by her husband Bob, and four children: Ann McFarlane (Portland); Paul McFarlane and his wife Leslie (Boise, ID); Sarah Heller McFarlane and her husband Jonathan (Seattle, WA); and James McFarlane and his wife Julie (Bend, OR). She is also survived by grandchildren Abraham, Vanessa, Grace, Margaret, Bobby, Louise, and Johnny; brother Drew Hall and his wife Miriam; sister Nancy Kaylor and her husband Dick, and sister Grace McMichael and her husband Mort and countless other beloved family members and friends. </p>
<p>We will celebrate Betty on Saturday, January 30, 2010 at 1:30 p.m. at the Oak's Park Pavillion. Please bring a Potluck finger food appetizer or desert to share (no beverages please) or a food donation for the Oregon Foodbank. Bring your instruments and your voices!</p>
<p>Rememberances can be made to the Fellowship of Reconciliation or the Puget Sound Guitar Workshop Scholarship Fund. The family would like to thank the staff of Terwilliger Terrace and Kaiser Hospice for their loving care of Betty.</p>
