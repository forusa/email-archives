<p>At one point in your life or another, you probably had to  move: pack up your things into boxes, throw away the old stuff  and start  over again in a new house, new town or new country. Maybe it was a  relief to get rid of certain things. Maybe you  cried. Maybe you found an old photo and laughed at how silly you looked  "back then."</p>
<p>In Colombia, almost 5 million people didn't have the luxury of packing up  anything or deciding what they would like to take with them  and what they would leave behind. They fled their  homes because they feared for their lives. As one peace  community member told an FOR team member recently:</p>
<p><i>"This lot  here where we are standing has been my family's since I was a child.  Then came Urr&aacute; (a dam) and massive  displacement. People were offered a very small amount of money for their  homes; those that wouldn't sell were threatened by paramilitaries. They  killed lots of people. We fled from here in 1995 to a town nearby. But it was also dangerous there, and there was no work."</i></p>
<p>Today, as part of the <a href="http://forcolombia.org/dayofprayeraction10">National Days of Prayer  and Action for Colombia</a>, we are asking you to take action. We want  Colombia to be a place where people leave their  homes only because they choose to do so.  We have the right  to make this demand because our tax dollars are buying  helicopters and guns for  Colombia's war; helicopters and guns that strip  Colombians of their right to stay or go in their homes as they please.</p>
<p>Call your congressional representative today to demand a change in  U.S. policy toward Colombia!</p>
<h2><a name="call"></a>How to Make an  Effective Call</h2>
<p>Call the capitol switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask to be put through to your member of  Congress. (<a href="http://www.house.gov/zip/ZIP2Rep.html">You can look up your representative here.</a>) Ask the receptionist if you can speak with the foreign policy aide. If he/she is not available, leave a message.</p>
<p><i>Call script:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"I am a constituent of  Representative ________ calling to urge her/him to stop U.S. funding of helicopters and guns in Colombia, which  only contribute to the worst humanitarian crisis in this hemisphere, add fuel to the  fire of Colombia's conflict and diminish the security of U.S. and  Colombian citizens alike.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The U.S. needs to help solve rather than  contribute to this massive humanitarian crisis. A concrete action that  Representative ________ can do right now is to increase aid for internally displaced people and refugees in  Colombia, and to co-sponsor House Resolution 1224, which supports  displaced Afro-Colombian and indigenous people's rights.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"We need to  promote a negotiated end to the conflict, not fund the military and sign  base agreements that will only result in more violence. We need to  create opportunities for small-scale farmers and workers, rather than  passing a harmful free trade agreement. We need to face the fact that  the aerial spraying program from Plan Colombia has not reduced coca  production, has been a cause of displacement for many Colombian  families, and needs to be fully ended. Colombians are calling for peace.  Please join me in supporting their call by making these changes to U.S.  policy today."</p>
<p>(We're focusing on the House of Representatives right now  because of House Resolution 1224, but if you want to call your senators too, just  take out the part about the resolution in the  script above.)</p>
<p><a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=3025"><b>In addition to calling your representative, please follow up with an email using our easy online form.</b></a></p>
<p>Over the last few days, thousands of people like you have taken  action for Colombia through Face the Displaced gatherings and displays  in over 10 cities across the U.S and have shared both <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peaceincolombia">photos</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/group/peaceincolombia">videos</a> of their efforts.</p>
<p>In May, our partners  in Washington D.C. will deliver hundreds of Face the Displaced posters  to members in Obama's administration. We'll keep you updated on how your  message is making its way to the White House!</p>
<p><a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/942524272"><b>Join our free webinar on US Colombia Policy Monday, April 26</b></a>: FOR is presenting a special webinar at 2:00 PM Eastern with John Lindsay-Poland, discussing Colombian human rights, U.S. policy, military bases in Latin America, and what you can do.</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued commitment to build a world  in which all of us enjoy the same kinds of basic human rights.</p>
