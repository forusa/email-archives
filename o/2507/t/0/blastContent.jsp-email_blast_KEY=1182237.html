<div class="contentbody"><!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="content" --><p>On June 13, 2010, the National Council of Churches will present "The Conscientious Objector," the true story of Army Medic Desmond Doss, a CO who overcame ridicule for his refusal to carry a weapon, then distinguished himself by heroically saving lives on battle fields across the Pacific during World War II.  In one incident, unarmed and unprotected, Doss rescued 75 wounded comrades at risk of certain death on Okinawa.  He ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>
<p>NBC affiliates have a six-month window from the initial air date in which to schedule the program, so it could be carried anytime from June 13 until December 12, at the local affiliate's discretion.   But the network "feed" of the program occurs only once -- the date and time of the feed is listed on the internal NBC computer advisory (the APT system) that is available to all its stations.  So it's important for the station to tape that feed for later broadcast.</p>
<h2>TAKE ACTION</h2>
<p>Call or write your local NBC affiliates and ask the local station manager (or the program director) when they intend to broadcast this program.  Many affiliates fear criticism for offering such programming.  It really helps if a local station manager or program director gets encouragement from viewers who can assure them there will be a supportive and appreciative local audience for the program.</p>
