We invite participants to explore ways  that international solidarity can make the difference countering the  expansion of US militarism in Latin America and spread the word about  the FOR&rsquo;s Peace Presence in Colombia, which offers a unique opportunity  to share the lives of courageous peasant farmers striving for a life in  peace dignity.&#160;</p>

                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">During the last 18 months the Obama  administration has embarked on a surge of US military expansion in Latin  America - supporting Honduras&rsquo; military coup, occupying Haiti after  January&rsquo;s earthquake, arranging to deploy 7,000 marines to Costa Rica,  gaining access to over seven military bases in Colombia - even while we  struggle with the domestic economic crisis. As the White House prepares  next year&rsquo;s budget, we are distributing postcards to tell President  Obama it is time &ldquo;We want a budget for our communities, not guns in  Latin America.&rdquo;</p>

                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">Jos&eacute; Alvaro left his 14-year-old  daughter Jenny Torres to take care of her two younger brothers Jimmy, 9,  and Jeferson, 6, on October 14, while he worked on a nearby farm in  Tame, Arauca. He left a cell phone with her, but after she didn&rsquo;t answer  several calls, he went home and, not finding them, reported their  disappearance.</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">The children&rsquo;s bodies were found the  next day in a shallow grave with signs of strangulation and knife  wounds. Jenny Torres&rsquo; body showed signs of rape. Army Lieutenant Raul  Mu&ntilde;oz was arrested last week for the crime and for another rape of a  teenage girl in the area committed on October 2. Two colonels and other  officers from the same army unit have also been suspended.<img width="200" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="150" border="1" align="right" src="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/images/JennyTorres.jpg" alt="Jenny Torres" /></p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">Lt. Mu&ntilde;oz belongs to the 45<sup>th</sup>  Counter-guerrilla Battalion, which is part of the 5<sup>th</sup> Mobile  Brigade. The battalion and brigade have been approved for U.S.  assistance every year since at least as far back as 2003 through last  year.</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">The military, for the most part, has  reacted responsibly, aggressively investigating, isolating a suspect  unit, and turning evidence over to civilian agencies.&#160;However, the  commander of the Army&rsquo;s 18<sup>th</sup> Brigade, General Rafael Alberto  Neira Wiesner which operates in the same state and received much U.S.  aid from 2002-2008, initially urged a local leader to condemn the  community group investigating the crime as &ldquo;playing the game of the  guerrillas.&rdquo; After evidence indicated Mu&ntilde;oz&rsquo;s culpability, General Neira  met with the children&rsquo;s father, Jos&eacute; Alvaro Torres, to apologize.  Torres said no one could pardon this crime.</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">The United States, by law, should  have cut off assistance to the 45<sup>th</sup> Counter-guerrilla  Battalion, in 2005, after the Jesuit human rights group <a href="../../../../../www.nocheyniebla.org/files/u1/30/pdf/14Noviembre20.pdf">Center  for Popular Research and Education reported</a> the killing by 5<sup>th</sup>  Mobile Brigade troops of nine-year-old Karly Johanna Su&aacute;rez Torres in  November 2004. Members of the 5<sup>th</sup> Mobile Brigade reportedly  committed five more killings of civilians in 2007, but aid continued to  flow. The State Department recently informed our partners at US Office  on Colombia that assistance to the 5<sup>th</sup> Mobile Brigade has  been suspended.</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">A European Union-supported study  found that <a href="http://www.humanidadvigente.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149%3Aninas-y-adolescentes-de-arauca-victimas-del-conflicto-armado-&amp;catid=26&amp;template=plantillahumanidadvigenteinterna&amp;Itemid=1">girls  in Arauca live in constant fear</a> of getting caught in combat and of  sexual violence by soldiers and members of other armed groups. In April  of this year, the human rights group Humanidad Vigente reported the rape  of another girl in the area by army troops, reportedly of the 18<sup>th</sup>  Brigade. That is the context in which Lt. Mu&ntilde;oz committed his crimes.</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">How is it that the United States can  assist a battalion at least seven years in a row and not identify and  address this kind of psychopathic behavior? What was the United States  teaching the 45<sup>th</sup> Counter-guerrilla Battalion? In the new  Congress, where Republicans now control committees in the House and  Democrats in both chambers act in fear, who will ask these questions of  those in the State Department and MilGroup who might have answers?</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">In another part of Colombia, an Army  officer, Edgar Iv&aacute;n Florez Maestre, testified last December about  &ldquo;legalizations&rdquo; &ndash; calculated killings of civilians, for pay, that were  then claimed as guerrillas killed in combat. The killings were carried  out by members of the &lsquo;Calibio&rsquo; Battalion and, according to the  soldier&rsquo;s testimony, coordinated by the battalion commander, at that  time receiving U.S. assistance. But a colonel he named as coordinating  these macabre killings has never been investigated. In fact, Colombia&rsquo;s  current attorney general has said more than once that he will not  prosecute higher-level commanders implicated in such killings.</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">Usually hidden inside military  experience, there is transformation here. Some soldiers, like Florez  Maestre, have spoken out about the abuses they have witnessed (and in  some cases participated in). &ldquo;I want it to be known that they talked to  us of human rights and legality knowing that on the other hand they were  doing bad procedures, so there was a double morality,&rdquo; Florez Maestre  said. &ldquo;I want all this to become public.&rdquo;</p>
                                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">His sorrow is a seed for something  quite different, a better path. To get on that path ourselves, we need  to resolve our own double morality. Jenny Torres and her brothers won&rsquo;t  come back, but by not looking away, by working to end these wars, we  help prevent more pain and degradation like that of the Torres family,  of Raul Mu&ntilde;oz, and of those U.S. officials who put aside the abuses of  the 5<sup>th</sup> Mobile Brigade to keep preparing its soldiers for  war.</p>

                                                <div style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><i><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black;">By Moira Birss</span></i></div>
                                                <p>When FOR staff asked if I could travel to a conference on civilian  resistance to militarism in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico during the last  weekend in October, I jumped at <img width="280" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="210" border="1" align="right" src="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/images/ForoMural1.JPG" alt="mural in Juarez1" />the chance to visit a country often compared to  Colombia, where I recently spent two years as a human rights  accompanier.</p>
                                                <p>However, as my departure date grew closer, I became more and more  nervous. The violence wracking Mexico, largely fueled by the country&rsquo;s  drug war, is magnified in the border town of Juarez, just across the Rio  Grande from El Paso, Texas, and often vies for the dubious title of  most dangerous city in the world. So just because I spent two years in  Colombia as a human rights accompanier, and knew that the mainstream  news stories about Mexico I had read didn&rsquo;t tell the whole story, the  concentration and apparent randomness of the violence in Juarez, at  least as portrayed in mainstream media, worried me.</p>
                                                <p>Just days before my departure for Ciudad Juarez, for example, four  maquila factory workers were killed and fifteen more injured when gunmen  shot up three company buses carrying the workers home.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn1">[1]</a> Since 2008, the number of murders has  surpassed 6,500 in a city of about 1.5 million.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn2">[2]</a> New York City, with a population of 8.3  million, had just 1,570 murders in a similar period.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
                                                <p>But despite my nervousness, I had made a commitment and was  determined to go. FOR asked me to attend the Foro Internaci&oacute;nal Contra  La Militarizaci&oacute;n y la Violencia &ndash; the International Forum Against  Militarization and Violence. As U.S. government officials continue to  herald the application of U.S. Colombia policy in Mexico, those of us  who have worked in Colombia and strongly criticize the human rights  implications of that policy are seeking to get involved in the Mexico  policy discussion.</p>
                                                <p>I flew from San Francisco to El Paso on Friday morning, took a cab to  the Sante Fe Bridge, and crossed over the Rio Grande. I met up with my  hosts on the Ciudad Juarez side, and from there they took me to the  starting point of the &ldquo;walk against death,&rdquo; the Foro&rsquo;s opening event and  the eleventh such march that the Juarez organizations planning the Foro  had organized. We marchers were a small group of about forty, with a  few signs, a few drums, and a bullhorn. Banners carried by the marchers  read &ldquo;Ni un muerte mas&rdquo; (Not one more death) and &ldquo;Por una cultura  diferente&rdquo; (For a different culture). The most common chant translates  roughly as &ldquo;Juarez isn&rsquo;t a barracks, get the army out of here!&rdquo; A few of  the student marchers had spray paint and where tagging phrases like  &ldquo;savage capitalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;not another death&rdquo; on the empty walls that the  march passed.</p>
                                                <p>As we approached the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez where the  Foro was to take place, a siren wailed behind us. Those of us near the  front turned to check on the rear of the march, but before my brain even  registered that the open-air black jeeps packed with men in balaclavas  and assault weapons were federal police, four shots rang out. There was a  collective gasp, and much confusion. Word began to spread that the  shots had been into the air, but suddenly two more rang out. Though I  was near the front of the march and the confrontation with the federal  police near the back, I soon pieced together what had happened.</p>
                                                <p>As the spray painters were finishing their last tag, the federal  police had pulled up, yelled at the kids to stop, then fired a round of  shots into the air. The kids, spooked and unarmed, turned and ran  through the university gate, and that&rsquo;s when the federal police shot the  second round of shots.</p>
                                                <p>That second round, however, was not fired into the air, but at the  kids running away. One of the bullets struck sociology student Dario  &Aacute;lvarez Orrantia in the back from such close range that his guts spilled  out where the bullet left his stomach. Seeing that they had perhaps  mortally injured a student, some of the federal police jumped down from  their jeeps and began to drag Dario by his leg, likely attempting to  take him away to cover up what had happened. Witnesses, shaken though  they were, somehow had the courage to stop the federal police from  taking Dario, and instead rushed him to the emergency room in a private  car.</p>
                                                <p>Inside the university, tensions ran high. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a compa&ntilde;ero!&rdquo; one of  Dario&rsquo;s classmates wailed as a friend dragged her away from the gate.  Others cursed the federal police, exclaiming that the shooting served as  yet another example of the violence and corruption of the federal  forces sent to Juarez in February of last year in response to the city&rsquo;s  violence.</p>
                                                <p>The federal police had taken over control of security in Juarez from  the military in April of this year, ostensibly to bring more &ldquo;community  policing&rdquo; to the city.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn4">[4]</a> The federal police takeover was in part  in response to widespread complaints of human rights abuses by the  military, which in turn had controlled the city since March 2008.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
                                                <p>As evidenced by Dario&rsquo;s shooting, the Federal Police haven&rsquo;t exactly  become a beloved community police force, however. Nor have they  succeeded in reducing violence in the city. On just one day, October  31&mdash;my last day in Juarez&mdash;there were 10 murders.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn6">[6]</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>
                                                <p>Despite the heated emotions caused by the shooting, Foro organizers  decided that the event should continue, albeit with many changes in the  schedule. Dario was a constant presence the entire weekend. &ldquo;An injury  to one is an injury to all," read a banner hung from one of the  buildings, and participants and presenters regularly referred to the  incident.</p>
                                                <p><img width="280" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="210" border="1" align="left" src="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/images/ForoMural2.JPG" alt="Juarez mural 2" />Impunity appears to reign in Mexico with as much  of an iron grip as in Colombia. For example, since the early 1990s,  hundreds&mdash;maybe even thousands, according to unofficial figures&mdash;of women  have disappeared in the city, most never to be heard from again. Those  whose bodies were recovered showed signs of torture, rape and  mutilation. Despite the horrific nature and widespread occurrence of  these crimes, the government has opened few investigations and barely  followed through on any of them.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn7">[7]</a> Though media attention has waned and  investigations are nearly nonexistent, the killings continue: nearly 150  women have been killed in Juarez so far in 2010.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn8">[8]</a>&#160;</p>
                                                <p>Through experience of Dario&rsquo;s shooting, along with stories told to me  at the Foro, I began to realize that Mexico and Colombia have more in  common than I may have realized. True, I&rsquo;ve known that the U.S. has sent  billions of dollars&mdash;over $1.5 billion in the last three years&mdash;for the  war on drugs in Mexico, comparable to the $5 billion in Plan Colombia  funding since 2000. But I hadn&rsquo;t realized that human rights abuses by  the Mexican military are nearly as rampant as in Colombia, or that there  seems to be an institutional effort to stigmatize the defense of human  rights in Mexico, as I know from personal experience exists in Colombia.</p>
                                                <p>In September 2008, for example, Mexican General Felipe de Jes&uacute;s  Espitia accused human rights defenders of being financed by  narcotraffickers to discredit the army.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn9">[9]</a> Such rhetoric is all-too-similar to  former Colombian president Alvaro Uribe&rsquo;s regular statements that human  rights defenders have links with the FARC in order to discredit the  army.</p>
                                                <p>Though Silvia, who works at a local human rights organization, told  me that Dario&rsquo;s shooting was unprecedented for its directness, many  Juarenses have wanted to rid the city of federal police since they  arrived, not only for their excessive use of force but for extortion and  complicity with drug cartels. In September the government fired 3,200  federal officers&mdash;10 percent of the total force&mdash;after widespread  allegations of misconduct including corruption. Between May and  September, the Human Rights Commission of Chihuahua (the state in which  Juarez is located) received 60 complaints for abuse of authority. Fifty  of those were against federal police for murder, theft, kidnapping and  extortion.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
                                                <p>Like in Colombia, human rights defenders have been specific targets.  In January, human rights activist Josefina Reyes was killed by armed men  who, before shooting her in the head, referred disparagingly to her  work with NGOs. Reyes had worked to document abuses by the Mexican  military.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn11">[11]</a> Chihuahua State Human Rights  Commissioner Gustavo de la Rose Hickerson now works from exile in El  Paso because he fears the same fate.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn12">[12]</a> Responding to Josefina&rsquo;s death, de la  Rosa Hickerson said that human rights defenders &ldquo;are in grave risk, we  become enemies of the criminals and of the Army: the cartels don&rsquo;t want  us to investigate their crimes and their arrangements with the police  and the Army, and the soldiers don&rsquo;t tolerate that we denounce their  abuses.&rdquo;<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
                                                <p>Nonetheless, some good seems to have resulted from Dario&rsquo;s shooting.  The incident has galvanized youth in Juarez to organize. Before the  shooting, students in Juarez didn&rsquo;t have an organization of their own.  They have now formed the <a href="http://aestudiantiljuarense.com/">Asociac&oacute;n Estudiantil  Juarense</a> (Juarez Student Association), and on November 2 organized  several hundred marchers to denounce Dario&rsquo;s shooting and protest the  military and federal police presence in Juarez.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
                                                <p>Mexican organizations aren&rsquo;t the only ones demanding demilitarization  of the drug war in Mexico. Dozens of U.S. and Mexican organizations  have signed and are circulating a sign-on letter calling for a halt to  U.S. drug war funding to Mexican security forces, which adds to more  than $1.5 billion in the last three years.<a title="" name="_ftnref" href="blastContent.jsp-email_blast_KEY=1198262.html#_ftn15">[15]</a> The organizations are circulating a  sign-on letter right now demanding that the U.S. government focus  instead "on attacking the causes and structures of organized crime  within the United States' drug addiction and the demand for black-market  drugs, international financial transactions and transborder corruption,  arms trafficking--and aid Mexico in eliminating the roots causes of the  spread of crime such as poverty, inequality, unemployment and the lack  of opportunities for youth."
