Social movements in the region have responded with clear opposition to militarization and installation of foreign bases. FOR has joined the Continental Campaign for a Latin America without Foreign Bases, and is launching a pilot project to strengthen a coalition of activists that will monitor and organize nonviolent vigils at US military bases connected with Latin America through training or deployment of troops, war vessels or aircraft.</p>                                                 <p>With the message &ldquo;No US guns in Latin America,&rdquo; the pilot project is raising awareness with local communities on the impacts of military expansion in Latin America and how resources could find better use by filling domestic social needs.&#160;We have begun by urging people to let the White House know our priorities for Latin America policy, as it assembles next year&rsquo;s federal budget, through postcards to President Obama. With other U.S. organizations we also issued <a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/susana-pimiento/december-10-2010-day-action-against-foreign-military-bases-latin-america-0">a statement on December 10</a>, International Human Rights Day.</p>                                                 <p>An important way to resist military intervention is through actions that make it visible and express our reasons for opposing it.

Juan Carlos Mendoza, leader of the Citizen Action Party, <a href="http://www2.prensalibre.cr/pl/nacional/36792-plenario-aprobo-permisos-de-atraque-a-buques-artillados.html">explained that his opposition</a> to the agreement is based on the United States being at war and that, as such, even Coast Guard ships are under the mandate of the military. &ldquo;Costa Rica signed a patrolling agreement with civilian authorities and not with the military part. This could be violating the active and permanent neutrality of our country,&rdquo; he said.</p>                                                 <p>Another deputy, <a href="http://www.elpais.cr/articulos.php?id=38419">Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Villalta of the Broad Front, said</a> there is no evidence that the deployments have contributed to reducing drug addiction or to traffickers changing their routes away from Costa Rica.</p>                                                 <p>Meanwhile, the day after its approval of the US naval deployment, <a href="http://www.elpais.cr/articulos.php?id=38418">Costa Rica denounced Nicaragua</a> at the United Nations for the presence of troops along the San Juan River that serves as a border between the two nations, alleging that Nicaragua had &ldquo;invaded&rdquo; and &ldquo;occupied&rdquo; Costa Rica. The same day, <a href="http://www.elpais.cr/articulos.php?id=38499">Nicaragua protested</a> a &ldquo;incursion&rdquo; into Nicaragua by Costa Rican ships and a plane. Costa Rican ambassador to the UN Eduardo Ulibarri said that his country has no military, and has instead appealed to the OAS, but that Nicaragua had rejected the OAS&rsquo;s jurisdiction. Nicaragua asserts that the troops dredging the river are in their own territory, which extends to the Costa Rican side of the river.<img width="200" height="279" border="1" align="right" src="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/images/USSKearsarge.jpg" alt="warship to Costa Rica" class="right" /></p>                                                 <p>The approval to deploy armed U.S. ships and helicopters to Costa Rica sends a message that the United States could use the threat of force to arbitrate the conflict, probably in Costa Rica&rsquo;s favor. Republican Senator Richard Lugar took Costa Rica&rsquo;s side in <a href="http://lugar.senate.gov/issues/foreign/pdf/MCC.pdf">a December 15 letter</a> to the Millennium Challenge Corporation, urging action against Nicaragua.</p>                                                 <p>At the same time, the United States continues to deploy troops in smaller numbers to Nicaragua as well, mostly for training missions. <a href="http://legislacion.asamblea.gob.ni/Normaweb.nsf/%28$All%29/DE64F250B5C08B78062576BD00585099?OpenDocument">Nicaragua authorized</a> more than 700 U.S. troops to conduct exercises and training in Nicaragua this year, including a Special Forces unit that conducted an exercise in May. Nicaragua reportedly approved another U.S. deployment for 2011 on December 13.</p>                                                 <p>Last July, when the United States and Costa Rica agreed to deploy up to7,000 US Marines and 46 warships, some of them assault ships armed with Sparrow missiles, to army-less Costa Rica for counter-drug operations, some Costa Ricans were upset. &ldquo;I love my country without soldiers,&rdquo; read a popular statement. One legislator sued in the courts to turn back the agreement, so far unsuccessfully.</p>                                                 <p>Only two of the announced ships deployed to Costa Rica, one of them for &lsquo;humanitarian missions.&rsquo; The other, USS Rodney Davis, conducted counterdrug operations in August.</p>                                                 <p>The US Navy&rsquo;s Fourth Fleet again plans to deploy ships to Costa Rica for the first six months of 2011. This time, there are no Navy ships on the list (and no US Marines), only US Coast Guard vessels.
