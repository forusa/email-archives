MOVICE consists of&#160; more than 5,000 victims of state violence and 300 human rights and political organizations. Since 2008, MOVICE has proclaimed March 6 as an international day of solidarity with victims of state violence. This year MOVICE is organizing actions between March 6 and March 11 around the right to land. Over the past 20 years, more than 4 million farmers, indigenous people and Afrocolombians have been expelled from their lands in Colombia, most to make way for economic interests such as oil, mining and oil palm plantations.<br />

                                                The Colombian government has proposed a law regarding victim's rights and land restitution without consulting with victims. MOVICE believes that this proposal does not respect the minimum national and international standards on victims' rights.<br />

                                                MOVICE asks people, organizations, groups and social movements around the world to show their solidarity with&#160; victims of state violence by sending a picture of their foot and/or feet by <b>today, March 6</b>, to m6vida@gmail.com. Let them know where you are sending your photo from. The photos will be used to accompany legal and symbolic actions, to be held between 6 and 11 March.<br />

                                                <h3>for Pentagon's Military Base Construction in Colombia</h3>
                                                <p><i>Last month, <a href="http://forusa.org/end-us-military-aid-colombia/january-2011-colombia-peace-update#AOB">FOR  revealed that the Pentagon has signed contracts </a>for construction of an  "Advanced Operations Base" in Colombia, despite a Constitutional Court  ruling that the U.S.-Colombia base agreement is non-existent. Colombian  Senator Robledo responded by demanding information from Colombia's  Defense Minister.</i></p>
                                                <p><em>El Espectador,  February 17, 2011</em><em><br />
                                                </em></p>
                                                <p>In July 2009 an  agreement that would allow U.S. soldiers to operate from seven bases in  Colombia -  as a strategy to fight drug trafficking and terrorism - was  about to be signed by the Colombian and U.S. governments. When details  of the agreement were revealed,&#160; it was a Trojan Horse. Then-President  &Aacute;lvaro Uribe described it as "the most convenient thing for the  country"; armed forces commander General Fredy Padilla had to send a  conciliatory message to neighboring Venezuela and Ecuador, who saw the  agreement as a threat, and opposition sectors spoke of "violations of  sovereignty."</p>
                                                <p>Uribe even had to  give explanations to the Union of South American Nations during a  special meeting in August 2009. A year later, the Constitutional Court  gave the final word by declaring the agreement illegal. The opinion,  written by Justice Jorge Iv&aacute;n Palacio and supported by the majority of  the court's members, established that the document was not an agreement  but a treaty that had to pass through the Congress. The decision took  effect immediately, and the legislature was ordered to consider  legislation for a treaty that, if approved, would allow the use of  national military bases by U.S. soldiers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                But it seems the story  didn't end there. Senator Jorge Robledo of the Democratic Pole, in a  letter sent to Defense Minister Rodrigo Rivera, asks for an explanation  for why the U.S. Army has signed 126 contracts for more than $12 million  for construction on Colombian military bases, some of which were  apparently signed after the Court's prohibition. The senator drew on  information published by the U.S. government itself, in September 2010,  with statistics of public expenditures.</p>
                                                <p>He says that the U.S.  army signed agreements for nearly $5 million to construct facilities on  Colombian bases in Tolemaida, Larandia, and M&aacute;laga Bay. In addition,  there is an agreement signed September 30 by the Defense Department with  the HCS Group, to provide services for an "advanced operations base  center of the Special Operations Command South, in Tolemaida." According  to Robledo, the aim of these contracts is the same as the treaty  overturned by the Court.</p>

                                                <p>In response, the  Defense Minister stated that, effectively, the U.S. government has  financed with aid the construction of facilities and infrastructure on  Colombian bases, with the purpose of strengthening the national  military's capacity, that in no case implies that U.S. soldiers may  carry out operations on the facilities. "The United States Armed Forces  are developing work of advising and training the Colombian military, in  compliance with the agreement regarding an Army mission, a Naval  mission, and Air mission of the United States Armed Forces in Colombia  of 1974," he explained from his office. <br />
                                                <br />
                                                The work by U.S.  soldiers is conducted in the Professional Soldiers School in Nilo,  Cundinamarca; the Armed Forces Joint Helicopter School in Melgar and  Flandes; The Marine Transportation Battalion in Malagana, Bolivar; and  in military bases in Larandia, Caquet&aacute; and M&aacute;laga Bay. The majority of  them, the ministry said, are part of Plan Colombia. [Click on map to see locations of U.S. soldiers and contractors in Colombia, according to the Defense Ministry.]</p>
                                                <p>In any case,  questions and responses announce a debate. For former Constitutional  Court magistrate Alfredo Beltr&aacute;n Sierra, the building of infrastructure  by a foreign government constitutes "a clear violation of national  sovereignty," more so when these are military structures. "Remember that  the government already tried to justify the establishment of U.S.  troops with a disguised agreement that the Court finally overturned."</p>
                                                <p>Beltr&aacute;n explained  that the only way to allow this work to be carried out by foreign  governments is by an international treaty that must comply with all the  requirements of the law. "If this is really occurring, it is a flagrant  violation of sovereignty and the president, as the chief executive, must  come out to respond and give an explanation," he concluded.</p>

                                                <p>Seventy-two hours has been  enough to show the two faces of reality in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, the state of  Chihuahua, and all of Mexico. On Saturday and Sunday January 29 and 30, a  pluralistic, committed, nonviolent and deeply active and reflective  citizen participation marked the first Event for Justice, which has its  epicenter in this border, with parallel mobilizations in Chihuahua and  Mexico City.<br />
                                                <img width="300" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="225" border="1" align="left" src="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/images/no-mas-sangre2small.jpg" alt="No Mas Sangre at fence" /><br />
                                                With fasting at the [Benito] Ju&aacute;rez Monument, in the  neighborhood of Villas de Salv&aacute;rcar, at the Gandhi monument in Mexico  City, and at the site in Chihuahua where [human rights activist]  Marisela Escobedo was shot to death [in December], social and civic  organizations and unaffiliated citizens remember the first anniversary  of the massacre of 18 youth in Villas de Salv&aacute;rcar, as well as  celebrating the passing of Bishop Samuel Ruiz [who died January 24] and  commemorate Mahatma Gandhi [on the anniversary of his death] in action  and reflection. Hundreds of protesters unite at the point where the wire  fence divides the town of Anapra, Chihuahua from Sunland Park, New  Mexico to proclaim: &ldquo;No to blood, no to violence, no to femicide.&rdquo;<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The  weekend undoubtedly has been the most intense, visible, pluralistic and  united event that citizens have done, especially in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, to  demand justice that brings a dignified peace. This mobilization managed  to capture the attention of the press and public opinion nationally and  internationally. It brings together hundreds of very diverse kinds of  activists: anarchists, trotskyists, supporters of [Mexican <span class="caps">PRD</span> leader] L&oacute;pez Obrador, feminists, Christians,  cultural activists, social and nongovernmental organizations,  associations in struggle, such as that of the doctors&hellip; etcetera. The  Paso del Norte Human Rights Center, the initial organizers, has received  more than 2,000 letters of support via email. In cyberspace, for sure,  especially on social networks, there is also a gigantic mobilization.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Nevertheless,  the good feelings of hope generated by this event had not dissipated,  when the Chihuahua media reported, in the 48 hours from Sunday to  Tuesday, several murders of women:<br />
                                                <br />
                                                On January 30 the Federal  Police again mark with an M for muerte [death] its path through Ciudad  Ju&aacute;rez: at a checkpoint they kill with six shots a youth, Karina Ibeth  Ibarra Soria, 16 years old, who dies a few hours later. In the south of  the state nar Parral, the bodies of three teenaged girls between 15 and  17 years old are found, beheaded. In the town of Santa Isabel, a drunk  man threatens and then attacks policewoman Mar&iacute;a del Refugio Nev&aacute;rez  Villalobos, dragging her for 75 meters and destroying her body. And in  Ju&aacute;rez on January 31, Maribel Hern&aacute;ndez, 31 years old, a distributor of  the newspaper El Diario, is murdered by close-range shooting in the very  center of the city. So the number of femicides in the first month of  2011 rises to 29, 7.25% more than in the same month last year, according  to the organization Justice for Our Daughters.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                On the same days,  Inegi reports that Chihuahua State leads in the rate of femicides, with  13.09 per 100,000 women in 2009. This shameful statistic continues in  Chihuahua because the continuous high-profile efforts of women&rsquo;s  organizations to apply the Alba Protocol to the search for disappeared  women, or to declare an Alert on Gender Violence have been ignored by  the authorities at all levels.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Violence in Chihuahua doesn&rsquo;t  diminish, neither in femicides nor in the murders of youth. Neither do  the attacks on human rights by the Federal Police and Army. Precisely  for this reason it is urgent to respond to and broaden the citizen  mobilizations such as last weekend&rsquo;s. It is necessary that the seeds  Ju&aacute;rez is planting flourish throughout the country in vigorous civic and  ethical insurgency that drubs the powers that continue to impose their  strategy of violence, death, impunity, and injustice.<br />

In  addition, action coordinated with United States activists; intensive use  of social networks in the organizing, combined with effective street  mobilization. Calls to local, regional, national and international  public opinion.<br />
                                                <br />

                                                <h3>Colombia's Displacement Crisis Keep Burning</h3>
                                                <p>"Approximately 280,041 people (about 56,000 homes) were displaced in Colombia in 2010 as a result of the armed conflict or other manifestations of social and political violence," the Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement, CODHES, the principal non-governmental organization monitoring forced displacement in Colombia, reported in February. Referring to the Colombian government's policy of "Democratic Consolidation," CODHES called <a href="http://www.codhes.org/images/stories/pdf/bolet%C3%ADn%2077.pdf">its report, "Consolidation of What?"</a></p>
                                                <p>"The most notable fact is that 32.7% of this population, at least 91,499 peple (18,300 homes) come from areas where the 'national plan of territorial consolidation' is developed, a flagship program of the government, conceived in 2007 'with the purpose of fulfilling the objectives of consolidation of the Democratic Security policy, maintain investor confidence and advance effective social policy.'"</p>
                                                <p>These zones, called Centers of Coordination and Integrated Attention (CCAI, for its Spanish acronym), are heavily supported by the United States, with both military and civilian assistance. The CCAIs have been criticized because they blur the lines between military and civilian roles, effectively militarizing development programs.</p>
                                                <p>"Of the 100 municipalities with the highest levels of forced displacement in Colombia last year, 44 were in CCAI zones, including six massive displacements that affected more than 2,684 people," CODHES reported.</p>
                                                <p>"In 2010, in 62 of the 86 municipalities with CCAI zones, at least eight paramilitary groups contiued operating (between old paramilitaries, rearmed ones, and new structures), while the FARC [guerrillas] maintained or reactivated its presence in 30 [CCAI] municipalities and the ELN continued acting in another four," CODHES says.</p>
                                                <p>Nineteen massacres occurred in the CCAI zones last year, they reported, with another 176 selective killings.</p>
                                                <p>"It is clear that violence is the primary cause of displacement, but it is also clear that, behind the armed actions and intimidation by armed groups against the population, and the inability of the State to protect it, powerful economic interests move through the territories that are the object of the consolidation policy."</p>
