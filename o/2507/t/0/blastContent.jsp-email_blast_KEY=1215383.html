<h2><a name="fta"></a>Free Trade Moment</h2>
<p>Representative George Miller was right when <a href="http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/blog/2011/05/colombia-trade-agreement-not-f.shtml">he  told Congress</a> two weeks ago, at a hearing on the US-Colombia Free  Trade Agreement:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"What do you get when you protest your  rights in Colombia? You get assassinations. You get death squads against  union members, union leaders and members of union families all across  the country.&#160;The American worker can compete, but you can&rsquo;t compete  against the Colombian army, the Colombian death squads, the Chinese army  &ndash; that&rsquo;s not fair competition. But that&rsquo;s what is protected in these  trade agreements."&#160;</p>
<p>On May 23, Carlos Arturo Castro became the eighth Colombian union  leader murdered in 2011.<br />
<br />
The time is now! Business interests are pushing the Obama Administration  and Congress to pass the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and  our best bet to stop it in its tracks is to raise our voices and make  our opposition heard. There are a variety of ways you can get involved  and join the movement. <br />

<p><img width="300" height="117" align="right" src="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/images/green.jpg" class="right" alt="" />The struggle to respect the human rights of young people is gaining ground. We need your help to keep the pressure on.<br />
<br />
These days in Bogota, there are more and more people talking about the illegality of street round ups and the right to declare yourself a conscientious objector. There are articles in the press about <a href="http://m.eltiempo.com/opinion/columnistas/lauragil/batidas/8996872/1">street round ups</a> and <a href="http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/temadeldia/articulo-263474-servicio-militar-conciencia">the struggle for conscientious objection</a>.</p>
<p>A month ago, members of Colombian conscientious objector groups from Medell&iacute;n (the Red Juvenil or Youth Network) and Bogota (ACOOC or Collective Action of Conscientious Objectors) along with international representatives from CIVIS, a Swedish agengy and FOR met with the director of the United Nations in Colombia who reiterated that UN is concerned about the issue. Last week 100 people attended <a href="http://www.civis.se/Dialogo-de-experiencias-Mi-mente">a public forum</a> to discuss both philosophical and political views related to conscientious objection and how these histories of struggle have developed in the United States, Europe and Colombia.<br />
<br />
And yet, street round ups continue. We need your help to put a stop to this illegal practice. Please take action here by sending a message to the Minister of Defense that you are concerned about the ongoing illegal practice of street round ups and that the Ministry of Defense should emit a statement to this effect.<br />

<h2><a name="land_restitution"></a>Land Restitution in Trouble</h2>
<p><i>By Susana Pimiento</i><br />
<br />
On May 5, Colombian Congress's Human Rights Commission held a special hearing in San Josesito, a settlement of the  San Jos&eacute; de Apartad&oacute; Peace Community. The Peace community's security concerns, such as the existence of four paramilitary bases in the area and the persistent attacks by army-backed demobilized guerrillas were highlighted in the hearing.&#160; <br />
<br />
<img width="350" height="233" border="1" align="left" class="left" alt="Congressman Ivan Cepeda" src="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2507/images/ivancepedasmall.jpg" />Rep. Ivan Cepeda said in <a href="http://www.rcnradio.com/noticias/iv-n-cepeda-denuncia-que-paramilitares-tienen-sitiado-san-jos-de-apartad/05-05-11#ixzz1LZxaHwYo">a radio interview</a> that San Jos&eacute; de Apartad&oacute; has been seized by paramilitaries. "The collusion between paramilitary structures, the army and the national  police in an radius of just few kilometers,  is beyond our understanding," he said. This, "in an area that is perfectly controlled by the army but apparently also controlled by paramilitary groups."</p>
<p>The special hearing at the Peace Community occurred amidst a bitter discussion of the Victims Law that was making its transit through Colombian congress and has been used by some, including former President Uribe, to torpedo land restitution efforts, under the excuse that land restitution would promote illegal occupation, thus threatening large land owners. <br />
<br />
Indeed, in a May 11 <a href="http://www.wradio.com.co/oir.aspx?id=1469937">radio interview</a>, President Uribe aired his opposition to acknowledging that&#160; there is an armed conflict in Colombia and the land reparation clause in the victims' law, saying that such recognition would promote illegal occupations. As an example, he referred to the presence of people associated with the Communist Party in Apartado that he said were behind illegal land occupations. On his twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AlvaroUribeVel/status/67548737538494464">Uribe also posted</a>&#160; comments making insidious accusations against Cepeda and other members of Congress for visiting San Jos&eacute; de Apartad&oacute;.</p>

<h2><a name="Honduras"></a>Construction Companies Urged Not to Bid on "Violent Outcomes" in Honduras</h2>
<p>More than 70 religious leaders, organizations, and academics <a href="http://forusa.org/sites/default/files/ltr2hondurascontractorsmay2011signers.pdf">on May 26 urged companies not to bid</a> on a $25 million contract to upgrade a U.S. military base in Honduras, saying the base &ldquo;violates Honduran sovereignty and the principles of democracy.&rdquo; The <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/USA/COE/DACA01/W91278-11-R-0023/listing.html">Army Corps of Engineers contract</a> is for barracks for enlisted soldiers at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras.</p>
<p>Honduras has seen extensive human rights violations since a June 2009 coup overturned the presidency of Manuel Zelaya, who is returning to Honduras on May 28. Soto Cano was used for refueling when Zelaya was illegally and forcibly removed from the country, the U.S. State Department has acknowledged.</p>
<p>Leaders of Catholic, United Methodist, Presbyterian, Jewish, and other faiths, 26 organizations, and 30 university professors and academics, including Honduras scholars Dana Frank and Suyapa Portillo and noted intellectual Noam Chomsky, told the companies that the U.S. military is &ldquo;supporting anti-democratic, violent and wealthy sectors in Honduran society&rdquo; and that the contract &ldquo;is not worth the costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://forusa.org/sites/default/files/ltr2hondurascontractorsmay2011signers.pdf">their letter</a>, the leaders cited the Honduran constitution&rsquo;s prohibition on a permanent foreign military presence, and said the &ldquo;use of &lsquo;hooches&rsquo; instead of permanent barracks on Soto Cano attempted to paper over this prohibition by making the U.S. base &lsquo;temporary,&rsquo; which would be definitively changed by the upcoming contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than 40 companies indicated their interest in the Army Corps contract, and some of them conducted a site visit to Soto Cano May 25.</p>
<p>U.S. forces on Soto Cano conduct training and other assistance to the Honduran military. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and other human rights organizations say the Honduran armed forces have carried out killings and arbitrary detentions of journalists, human rights defenders, gay and lesbian people, and opponents of the current government.</p>
<p>Honduras has among the highest murder rates in the world, as violence and drug trafficking have spiraled since the coup. Defense Department contracts in Honduras have more than doubled since 2007. &ldquo;Whether or not the U.S. military presence is contributing to the violence, it certainly is not reducing it,&rdquo; the letter said.</p>
<h2><a name="Mexico"></a>Mexico&rsquo;s Anti-Drug War March Demands Far-Reaching Political Reforms</h2>
<p><i>By Laura Carlsen</i></p>
<p>May 9 - Following a four-day march from Cuernavaca to Mexico City, an estimated 90,000 protesters poured into the central plaza. The march was led by relatives of victims and convoked by the poet, Javier Sicilia, whose son was brutally assassinated in March. Protesters in the march demanded far-reaching changes in Mexico&rsquo;s security policy and an end to the &ldquo;war on drugs&rdquo;. In speeches and documents they also called for political reforms to go the root of the alarming deterioration in public safety and well-being since President Felipe Calder&oacute;n deployed the army in an offensive against organized crime in December of 2006.</p>

<p>from <a href="http://www.semana.com/opinion/sumercenario/157094-3.aspx"><i>SEMANA</i>, May 21, 2011</a></p>
<p>This week, <i>The New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/world/middleeast/15prince.html?_r=1">published an article</a> about a secret army in the Arab Emirates. Most of these men come from Colombia. <br />
<br />
Many of them have no military training at all. They are guards who exchanged their poncho, thermos and shotgun for a rifle, an uncertain destiny and a vocation disdained by many: they are mercenaries. They sell themselves to the highest bidder to kill or die in foreign wars. Today they are in Abu Dabi. Behind the adventure that led these guards of frozen mornings in Bogota to the burning sands of the Middle East there is a strange business.<br />
<br />
The improvised soldiers of fortune, signed up by an international company, received lightening military instruction on farms and on Colombian military facilities. For that they used weapons from the government or confiscated from guerrillas. Someone from the armed forces supports the multi-million dollar business in the export of mercenaries. <br />
<br />
A series of photographs, taken in April 2010, shows a retired major named Fierro linked to the opeation, together with a U.S. man apparently named Robert Bowen. With them are another three foreigners and retired sergeant Victor Diaz, also part of the recruiting team. The photo shows a military lectern and in back is a sign on which you can see the acronym CCOPE, which [in Spanish] stands for Joint Special Operations Command, based in Facatativ&aacute;, Cundinamarca state. [FOR note: CCOPE was approved for U.S. military assistance in 2009-2010, as well as in previous years.] <a href="http://www.semana.com/photos/1516/ImgArticulo_T2_90178_2011521_232818.jpg">(See photo)</a><br />
<br />
Another image against shows Sergeant Diaz (ret.) giving firing instructions to two people, apparently women. A soldier in camouflage uniform accompanies him. <a href="http://www.semana.com/photos/1516/ImgArticulo_T2_90181_2011521_232916.jpg">(See photo)<br />
</a><br />
The third photo shows Major William Bode, the operation's program manager, next to the two women and two soldiers in camouflage. On a desk are bent providers and weapons different from those used by the Colombian military. <a href="http://www.semana.com/photos/1516/ImgArticulo_T2_90182_2011521_232927.jpg">(See photo)</a><br />
<br />
This week, <i>The New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/world/middleeast/15prince.html?_r=1">published an article</a> on the appearance of a secret army in the United Arab Emirates. Its mission is to care for the members of the royal family, watch over their oil pipelines and skyscrapers. The majority of these men - presented a members of an elite force - come from Colombia.<br />
<br />
The prestigious daily published<a href="http://www.semana.com/photos/1516/ImgArticulo_T2_90185_2011521_233052.jpg"> the entrance permits into the Emirates</a> of three of the international mercenaries. One is from Bogota, another from Medellin, and another from La Guajira [in Colombia's northeast]. <br />

The brains of the business is a well known international trafficker in cannon fodder. His name is Eric Prince and he founded Blackwater and XE Services, the same companies that in 2006 brought ex-soldiers, ex-police and ex-detectives from Colombia to serve as mercenaries in the Iraq war. They were offered a salaries of $7,000 a month, that was lowered to 4,000, then to 2,700, and finally to a thousand.</p>

<p>Five years ago, the news weekly <i>Semana</i> revealed in an article, <a href="http://www.semana.com/nacion/atrapados-bagdad/96550-3.aspx">"Trapped in Baghdad"</a> the claims of the naive Colombian mercenaries. They were not paid what was promised and had no way of returning to Colombia.<br />
<br />
An investigation by the U.S. State Department into XE Services tells the story of Mr. Prince's unorthodox procedures. The <a href="http://www.semana.com/photos/1516/ImgArticulo_T2_90184_2011521_233038.jpg">report by the Office of Defense Trade Controls</a> states that the company carried out unauthorized military training in Colombia. At that time, the Colombian link in the business was a company called ID Systems, a curious company that worked at the same time on computer matters for the Colombian Registry and on military issues. The names mentioned were Captain Gonzalo Guevara and Jos&eacute; Arturo Zuluaga Jaramillo.<br />
<br />
Some years later the same characters repeat. The company is now called Fortox, but it operates in Bogota at the same address as ID Systems, and <a href="http://www.semana.com/photos/1516/ImgArticulo_T2_90183_2011521_232952.jpg">Jos&eacute; Arturo Zuluaga Jaramillo is a member</a> of its board of directors. <br />
<br />
Captain Guevara, on the other hand, is no longer. Someone must have hated him too much. They killed him a year after the Iraq affair, as he was leaving a bakery on 127th Street in Bogota.</p>

<h3><a name="brief"></a>News Brief: Colombia Recognizes its Armed Conflict</h3>
<p>May 5, Bogota - The coalition Colombia-Europe-United States Coordination (CCEEU), which brings together 220 human rights and social organizations, announced its satisfaction that the Colombian government of Juan Manuel Santos has recognized that there is an armed conflict in Colombia.</p>
<p>For the CCEEU, the recognition of internal armed conflict in Colombia is a framework that makes responsibilities for respecting for international humanitarian law enforcible, as well as permitting punishment for violations by any of the armed groups.</p>
<p>We hope that recognizing the armed conflict in Colombia may also soon bring about the basis for the negotiated political solution of the conflict. In our judgement, peace with social justice is the only sustainable way to put an end to the social and armed conflict in Colombia.</p>
