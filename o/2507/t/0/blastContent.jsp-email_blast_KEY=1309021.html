<p>Friends,</p>
<p>On Aug. 9, when a black teenager named Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer, the small city of Ferguson lost its anonymity. Ferguson became a symbol of a criminal justice system that enacts racism on a daily basis, of a political structure that sees some of our civilians as expendable, and of a news media that stokes a racist fear of urban, working-class and poor people of color.<br />
<br />
<b>In the days and weeks following the killing of Michael Brown, the people of Ferguson raised their voices and occupied the streets in protest.</b></p>
<p><img border="0" align="right" width="250" height="250" alt="" class="right" src="../../images/ferguson-october_250.jpg" />Thousands of human rights workers and concerned citizens have joined them in a newly invigorated movement for justice -- not a new movement, since many communities of color have fought for their existence from the beginning -- and the Fellowship of Reconciliation is among them.</p>
<p><b>Members of FOR have been on the ground in Ferguson, recalling the historic role of FOR in connecting faith communities to the civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s.</b></p>
<h2>Rev. Osagyefo Sekou</h2>
<p>FOR Freeman Fellow and St. Louis-raised Rev. Osagyefo Sekou immediately joined in the peoples' actions. In his <a href="https://medium.com/theology-of-ferguson/the-gospel-is-not-a-neutral-term-an-interview-with-rev-sekou-ae7990e66fe2">groundbreaking interview</a>, Rev. Sekou said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" align="right" width="250" height="320" alt="" class="right" src="../../images/sekou-ferguson-october_heather-wilson_250.jpg" />"Black Christianity begins with the assumption of black humanity, which is a left-of-center project inside the American empire. The situatedness of the first century Palestinian living under Roman occupation is the same situatedness of black people in America. Thus we must resist in the way which Jesus resisted. We must be present with the least of these as he called and be willing to go to the cross as he did. Anything less is heresy."</p>
<p>FOR has brought skills and training to the table in the form of active nonviolent resistance, interpersonal conflict resolution, and coalition-building. FOR members who are working on campaigns to end the mass incarceration system in our country, the use of the death penalty, and the militarization of our communities know that their work is fundamentally based in fighting racism.</p>
<p><b>Police, prisons, and executions are merely the symptoms of a broken and divided society.</b></p>
<p>FOR has provided key assistance to this growing movement, particularly in the context of the national "<a href="http://fergusonoctober.com">Ferguson October</a>" mobilization. Rev. Sekou partnered with local faith leaders and national organizers from the <a href="http://www.piconetwork.org">PICO Network</a>, the <a href="http://sdpconference.info">Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference</a>, and <a href="http://sojo.net">Sojourners</a> to launch the "Faith in Ferguson" working group.</p>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="http://www.handsupunited.org">Hands Up United</a>, the <a href="http://www.dontshootstl.org">Don't Shoot Coalition</a> and other key organizations, Faith in Ferguson played a central role in organizing key aspects of the Weekend of Resistance -- including the nonviolent direct action trainings, the "interfaith mass meeting" on Sunday evening, and the "Moral Monday" civil disobedience action which drew widespread coverage.</p>
<h2>Jeff Stack</h2>
<p><img border="0" align="right" width="250" height="295" alt="" class="right" src="../../images/ferguson-oct-rural-mo.jpg" />Coordinator of Mid-Missouri FOR Jeff Stack brought four other activists from around the state to Ferguson.</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/jeff-stack/our-hearts-are-full-ferguson-mid-mo-for/13066">blog with reflections from the Missouri activists he brought</a> to the Weekend of Resistance, Jeff wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"An awakening is happening!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Change will happen as more and more join the courageous people of Ferguson and others struggling over the past two months."</p>
<h2>Rev. Hillary Gaston</h2>
<p>As FOR's chief operating officer, Rev. Hillary Gaston attended the Ferguson October Weekend of Resistance to assist Rev. Sekou with on-the-ground efforts. As a clergy, former law enforcement officer, and financial expert, Rev. Gaston was uniquely suited to provide "elder statesman" support.</p>
<p><a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/hillary-gaston/our-hearts-are-full-ferguson-after-weekend/13065"><img border="0" align="right" width="250" height="126" alt="" class="right" src="../../images/ferguson-oct-moral-monday.jpg" />In his reflection on the Ferguson October weekend</a>, Rev. Gaston noted in particular the calls from the young people of Ferguson during the interfaith rally on Sunday:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Their message, in their language, was simple and concise: We don't need you -- outsiders and older people -- to come here and tell us how we should respond to our pain and suffering. What we do need is for you to provide us with support and guidance. There was a clear indictment of the clergy and church for not being more visible and supportive of the youth and community, both during this period and in the past."</p>
<p>FOR is calling for justice for Mike Brown, but we're also advocating and training for nonviolent and reconciling responses to the underlying issues of police brutality, racial profiling and hypermilitarization in local communities.</p>
<h2>George Payne</h2>
<p><img border="0" align="right" width="250" height="178" alt="" class="right" src="../../images/ferguson-sharpshooter_wikimedia-jamelle-bouie.jpg" />Founder and director of <a href="http://www.gandhiearthkeepers.org/">Gandhi Earth Keepers International</a>, George Payne is an FOR member who traveled from Rochester, NY, to support Ferguson October.</p>
<p>He arrived, <a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/george-payne/ferguson-october-effect-militarized-police-forces-minority-communities/13062">he wrote in a reflection</a>, "to bear witness to crimes against humanity which have been no less, or  no more evil, than the killing we have heard about&#160;overseas."</p>
<h2>Bishop John Selders</h2>
<p>A supporter of FOR and pastor of <a href="http://amistaducc.org">Amistad United Church of Christ</a> in Hartford, Connecticut, Bishop Selders <a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/john-selders/our-hearts-are-full-ferguson-bp-john-selders/13051">reflected about why he felt called to travel to Ferguson</a> for the Weekend of Resistance:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"I know within myself that this is one of those moments, happening in real time, where those of us of faith, passion, and conviction -- with justice and fairness in mind -- must report for duty. Some of us have the chance to go to where the action is, and yet others of us can do our part right where we are."</p>
<h2>At FOR headquarters in Nyack, NY</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" width="450" height="298" alt="" src="../../images/ferguson-protest_cc-sally-savage.jpg" /></p>
<p>In another reflection in the collection entitled "Our Hearts Are Full of Ferguson," FOR's director of communications <b>Linda Kelly</b> <a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/for/our-hearts-are-full-ferguson-linda-e-kelly/13053">explains why she stands in solidarity with Ferguson</a>. Linda writes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The spirits of Michael, Trayvon, Renisha, Shantel, Amadou, and countless others are waking me up. All the young people standing with their hands up before the tanks and machine guns and tear gas are waking me up."</p>
<p>On Oct. 12, while <a href="http://fergusonoctober.com/day-of-action/hands-sabbath/">Hands Up Sabbath</a> was happening in Ferguson, Linda, Hailey Pessin, <a href="http://thepeacepoets.com/">the Peace Poets</a>, and more spoke at the Building Bridges Concert organized by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EndTheNewJimCrow">Rockland Coalition to End the New Jim Crow</a> which was sponsored by and held at FOR's national headquarters in Nyack, NY. More than 100 people gathered to raise awareness about mass incarceration, "<a href="http://bantheboxcampaign.org/">Ban the Box</a>," and police brutality; and to stand in solidarity with Ferguson.</p>
<p>Then, more than 50 people gathered at national headquarters on Oct. 23 for a panel discussion that included FOR's training coordinator <b>Gretchen Honnold</b>, who was also on the ground in Ferguson for the Weekend of Resistance. The discussion "After <a href="http://peoplesclimate.org/">the Climate March</a>, After Ferguson -- Where do we go from here?" explored ways in which to harness the momentum of these tremendous mobilizations of the people to sustain the power to effect real change.</p>
